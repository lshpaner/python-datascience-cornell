Creating Lists and Assigning Them to Variables

- In exercise1.py in the code editor window, create a list containing the 
numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4 (in that order), and assign it to the variable my_list

- In the next line of exercise1.py in the code editor window, write an 
expression to print the value of the variable my_list, using the built-in Python
print function

-In the interpreter window, enter %run exercise1.py and note that the value of 
my_list is printed.

- Items in a list can be accessed with the square brackets: my_list[n] will 
return the item at position n in my_list. Now add a line to the code in the 
editor that accesses the item at position 2 in my_list and assign it to the 
variable pos2. Print the value of pos2. Rerun the code file within the 
interpreter.

my_list = [1,2,3,4]
print(my_list)


pos2 = my_list[2]
print(pos2)
